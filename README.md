## 📝 Overview  
I analyzed customer churn for **Databel**, a telecom company experiencing a **26.68% churn rate**.  
Using **Excel**, I cleaned, prepared, and explored a dataset of over **6,600 customer records** covering demographics, plans, billing, and support interactions.

## 🔎 Key Findings  
- **Top churn drivers:** competitor offerings, poor customer support, and misaligned plans
